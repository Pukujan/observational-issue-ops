## Goal

Ship an OIO-owned, prepacked issue-log ontology and a safe installer that adopters can run against an explicitly selected repository. The installer must give every adopter the same OIO core definitions while letting that adopter extend vocabulary and project priority concepts without replacing the core.

## Why

OIO currently publishes a form and triage workflow but no installer or disposable adopter test. Agents cannot reliably discover a single default ontology, and adopters have to copy and maintain intake behavior themselves. OIO's own manifest also lags the certified CGM version required by the current ACS hot-load contract.

## Scope and boundaries

- In scope: OIO's default ontology, record and extension schemas, installer, generated/adopter-local form and triage artifacts, tests using disposable local Git repositories, documentation and OIO's own stack-contract reconciliation.
- Ontology scope: observational and operational issue-log filing only. It does not define general implementation authorization, task/PR progression, deployment, or release policy.
- The target repository owns its issue history and extension. Installation or validation must not write anywhere except the explicitly selected target and only within documented OIO-managed paths. OIO, ACS, CGM, and PCM are protected repositories: agent issue submission or file writes require explicit human direction naming the repository and action.
- Out of scope: edits to PCM, ACS, CGM, Octo DB, ACS/CGM/PCM repositories, or any adopter repository; changes to other repositories' protection/settings; automatic network updates during installation.
- Canonical dependency facts from the audit: PCM 0.6.0 at `4e2385474b4af9249ca009cbdcb38c4498932475`; CGM 0.5.12 at `6831f91e165b62d719c05eb492f7375fa932b560`; ACS HOTLOAD 0.1.0 at source commit `3a381eba11c6262c702f5d696878c371342e859a`. The current train file has `status: proposed`; it is not final authority. OIO validates PCM and CGM but lacks ACS runtime artifacts and a passing hotload checker.
- Priority is represented as a project-scoped ontology concept and hierarchical string path, never a floating-point value. Roots 1–100 and deeper numeric subdivisions are supported without a fixed depth; a defined parent may be assigned directly.

## Human outcome

A project can install a pinned OIO release into a disposable or real target, receive the default observational/operational issue vocabulary and intake files automatically, add a validated project ontology overlay, and rerun or upgrade without overwriting project-owned data or touching another repository.

## Verification

Use deterministic unit and integration tests. Create a disposable local Git repository and compare its tracked/untracked paths before and after installation. Verify fresh installation, repeat installation, valid extension, invalid/colliding extension rejection, modified-managed-file conflict, and explicit-target confinement. Run OIO's PCM, CGM, stack-train consistency, YAML/JSON Schema, secret, and installer checks. GitHub test-repository changes are excluded unless separately authorized.

## Checkpoint log

- 2026-10-03: task scoped on leaf issue #18 (parent #17) and branch created. Read-only audit confirmed PCM validation passes but GitHub review/admin enforcement is incomplete; CGM pin was behind the current train proposal and its required filename legend was missing; ACS was reference-only and lacks OIO-side runtime artifacts. Local changes now update CGM to 0.5.12 and add the filename legend, repair PCM worktree guidance, define and package the default ontology, add a fail-closed installer and triage review lanes, and test crash recovery/path confinement. Validation evidence and delivery status will be appended after completion.
- 2026-10-03: completed the OIO-only implementation and adoption audit. OIO pins PCM 0.6.0 and CGM 0.5.12; PCM continuity/preflight, the pinned CGM adapter validator, and release-train manifest checker pass. ACS HOTLOAD 0.1.0 remains a source reference only because OIO has no runtime assignments/leases/watchdog/claim flow and no passing ACS hotload check. The installer was exercised against a fresh disposable Git repository and its installed `--check` passed. At that point, 33 unit tests passed, and Sol's independent read-only review of PR #19 code head `341d224` found no remaining concrete blocker in the reviewed scope. The PR was open and GitHub `gates` passed at that head; no sibling repositories were written.
- 2026-10-03: three Luna reviews found two additional defects: a mismatched priority was labeled unresolved but serialized as path `1`; and installer path checks/writes were vulnerable to a concurrent managed-directory symlink swap. Triage now serializes unresolved priority with explicit `status: unresolved` and null path/concept, enforced by the record schema. Installer writes and journal recovery now use descriptor-relative no-follow operations and verify parent descriptors before temporary creation and replacement; tests move the opened directory outside the target and replace its path with an outside symlink during install and recovery, confirming the outside tree remains unchanged. Review-lane order is documented as a tie-break after source/account/project priority. All 36 tests, YAML/schema checks, PCM validate/preflight, CGM/train validators, Python compilation, secret scan and diff checks pass locally. Same-user concurrent races that relocate an already-open directory after a verification remain outside the installer guarantee and are documented. The fixes are pushed at `79a07499c52a18d5e64b8701f9ad9e67a9688003`, and GitHub `gates` passed on that head; no sibling or adopter repositories were changed. Awaiting human review of PR #19.
- 2026-10-03: PR #19 merged automatically after its required `gates` check passed; no approving review was required. Merge commit `e965d36b768063a3a8f3c4c5e8447a8938b700f4` is on `main`; the check passed on PR head `15162142223cdb3311cca7ff14e4c33fc3a6c284` (CI run 37103901718). The OIO default installer is ready for use against an explicitly selected adopter repository; its disposable adopter install/check and 36 deterministic regression tests passed on the merged source. PCM 0.6.0 and CGM 0.5.12 validate; ACS HOTLOAD remains a source reference without OIO runtime certification. No sibling or adopter repositories were changed. Leaf #18 is being updated with the post-merge receipt; parent #17 remains open for the broader governance research direction.
