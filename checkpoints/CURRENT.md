This is an as-of projection; live GitHub issues own progression. Link the owning leaf, parent ancestry and dependencies for active work.

## Program state

Phase: OIO has shipped a prepacked observational/operational issue ontology and safe adopter installer. The installer includes explicit source classes, account authority, project-scoped hierarchical priority paths, evidence-based risk/release review lanes, and protected-repository boundaries. OIO consumes PCM and CGM; ACS HOTLOAD is pinned and documented, but the local ACS runtime integration is not certified complete. Parent issue #17 remains open for broader governance research.

## Completed

- OIO-0001 (issue #1): continuity protocol initialized (PCM CLI 0.6.0); CGM adapter pinned to the 0.5.7 baseline at that historical merge; three narrative assets generated and recorded in `.content-system/asset-manifest.json`; the release train and OIO's pins written. Merged 2026-10-01 in PR #3 (squash `043f2e2`).
- OIO-0002 (issue #4): the form names `Pukujan/observational-issue-ops` as its publisher, and the required `gates` check failed closed when the manifest and the release train disagreed. Merged 2026-10-01 in PR #7 (squash `bf6402e`).
- OIO-0003 (issue #9): OIO began as an issue-log ticketing system, covering observational and operational records; its current ontology narrows that scope and distinguishes proposals/incident records; the release train moved to `Pukujan/agent-stack-train` and OIO's manifest repointed at it. Merged 2026-10-01 in PR #11 (squash `2a836a5`).
- OIO-0004 (issue #13): the README hero was regenerated as a PNG (with `google/gemini-3-pro-image`) to meet the current CGM adopter-README hero contract, replacing the JPG; the references in the README, the adapter, and the prompt record were updated. Merged 2026-10-02 in PR #14 (squash `c65c69b`).
- OIO-0005 (issue #18): shipped the prepacked observational/operational ontology, validated adopter extension scaffold, target-confined installer, local form/triage and 36-test disposable-adopter coverage. Merged 2026-10-03 in PR #19 (squash `e965d36`). The `gates` CI check passed on the PR head; the installer is ready for an explicitly targeted adopter installation. ACS runtime integration remains uncertified.

## Active

- none. OIO-0005 is delivered; its live leaf issue will receive the exact post-merge receipt. Parent design issue #17 remains open for the broader governance research request.

## Queued

- none.

## Blockers

- OIO pins the current ACS HOTLOAD module source but does not contain the runtime assignment, lease, watchdog, claim-queue, and claim-to-PR integration required for `hotload_check.py`; do not claim ACS runtime readiness.

## Next atomic action

Publish the post-merge receipt to leaf #18 and link parent #17; then continue the owner-requested governance research on #17. PR #19 merged as `e965d36b768063a3a8f3c4c5e8447a8938b700f4` after `gates` passed on head `15162142223cdb3311cca7ff14e4c33fc3a6c284` (CI run 37103901718). The previous task checkpoint's 36 tests, YAML/schema checks, PCM validation/preflight, CGM adapter and train-manifest validators, Python compilation, secret scan, and diff validation passed. The train at `Pukujan/agent-stack-train` remains `status: proposed`; ACS runtime integration remains uncertified.
